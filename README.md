# Bioreactor

This application was created to control valves for a bioreactor experiment that flew on a NASA zero-gravity research flight.

The code is incredibly specific for its given application.  It basically allows the team to open and close valves controlled
via bluetooth of an Arduino inside a sealed box.

The code was developed as a helper to ease our testing.  The experiment featured in the pictured below worked perfectly. :)
